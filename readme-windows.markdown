Shopify e-texteditor compatible tmbundle
========================================

These instructions are specific using Shopify Textmate bundle with [E-texteditor](http://www.e-texteditor.com/).

For more general bundle usage instructions, please see the [readme](https://github.com/meeech/shopify.tmbundle/blob/windows-compat/readme.markdown).

Download
--------

https://github.com/meeech/shopify.tmbundle/zipball/v1.0.5

**1.0.5 is the last known working version for e-texteditor. **

My Setup
--------

* Windows XP. A virtual machine, it is a pretty clean system - I use it just for checking things over in IE.
* e-texteditor. Make sure to do the install where you allow E to install cygwin tools - you will need those for the bundle to work
* PHP 5.3. You can try other versions, YMMV. I went and installed PHP from here: http://windows.php.net/download/ - the VC6 x86 Thread Safe was what I used

Usage
-----

See general usage instructions in the [readme](https://github.com/meeech/shopify.tmbundle/blob/windows-compat/readme.markdown).

* You need to make sure the **project pane** is active, or it can't pick up proper info on where it need to run [img](http://meeech.github.com/img/project-pane.png) 

Differences from Textmate
-------------------------

* No nice progress reports. You only get status on actions like download full theme once the action is done.

Please file any issues you may have at the [github project](https://github.com/meeech/shopify.tmbundle/issues).

Let me know where things aren't clear, and I'll screenshot it up, and expand on this readme.

Thanks,
